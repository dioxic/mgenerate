**mgenerate4j** is a tool for generating rich JSON documents from a template.

It can be used as a standalone application or as a library and is also extendable if you need to do something that isn't covered by the out-of-the-box functions. 
 
The core syntax is largely the same as [mgeneratejs][mgeneratejs] by Thomas Rueckstiess.
